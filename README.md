This project was initiated as a way to hold myself accountable for weight loss.

1. Login to a personalized webpage.
2. Ability to navigate to TDEE and input the values required.

    a. Weight
    b. Height
    c. Age
    d. Activity levels
    
3. Ability to input weight daily, which is then output to the user using:

    a. Chart.js
        I. Weight along the Y-Axis
        II. Date along the X-Axis
        
4. Ability for the user to input daily log notes. Could include the initial weigh in for the day, workouts completed, food eaten, etc. 
5. A way for the user to access the spoontacular web api for calorie specific recipes.
6. A way for the user to access specific workouts utilizing myfitnesspal api.
