# Abdelali - Project Pitch

A platform that allows users to record their weight and exercises, obtain their TDEE and find recipes that fit within a specific calorie range.

## Background

This started off as a personal project. I've always wanted a resource where I could submit my weight and exercises completed for a specific day. 

I ended up creating Track it, Lose it to supplment this need.

## MVP

- As a user, I want to be able to have a personalized page which I can view my favorited recipes, exercise notes, and a chart displaying my weight progress.
- As a user, I want to be able to submit my weight notes so that I can reference them at a later time (Track which body group I've done for the week vs which I haven't)
- As a user, I want to be able to get an accurate TDEE based on my Weight, Age, Height and Activity level using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my weight progress over time via a line graph.
- As a user, I want to be able to request and view a recipe, its ingredients and its instructions based on min and max calories.
