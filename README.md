#Track It, Lose It
This section provides an overview of the project's purpose and features.

The "Track It, Lose It" project was created to provide a structured, accessible system for personal weight loss, weight gain or weight maintenance accountability. 
The goal is to centralize and streamline the process of tracking health and fitness data, making it easier to stick to your weight goal journey.

Here are some key features:

Personalized Webpage: Each user can log into a personal account, ensuring privacy and customization.

Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) Calculation: Users can navigate to the TDEE section and input critical information such as:

a. Weight
b. Height
c. Age
d. Activity levels

These inputs allow for the calculation of the number of calories the user burns in a day, guiding dietary choices and tracking progress.

Daily Weight Input and Visualization: Users can input their weight on a daily basis. This data is then graphically represented using Chart.js, with:

a. Weight plotted on the Y-Axis
b. Date plotted on the X-Axis

This graphical representation helps users visualize their weight loss journey and monitor changes over time.

Daily Log Notes: Users have the option to input daily notes. These notes can include various details such as the day's initial weigh-in, workouts completed, food consumed, and so on. This feature encourages users to maintain a holistic view of their health and fitness routine.

Access to Spoonacular Web API: Users can access the Spoonacular Web API for calorie-specific recipes. This allows users to discover new, healthy recipes and integrate them into their meal plans, providing both variety and nutritional balance.

With these features, "Track It, Lose It" aims to support users on their weight loss journeys, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for tracking and analyzing their health and fitness progress.
